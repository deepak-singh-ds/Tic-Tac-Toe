# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is my web development project
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game that is simple to understand and play. Here's a comprehensive overview of the game, including rules, strategies, and how to implement it in code.
Overview and Rules
Players: Two, typically referred to as X and O.
Board: A 3x3 grid.
Objective: The first player to align three of their marks (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
Gameplay:
Players take turns to place their marks on an empty cell of the grid.
The game ends when one player has three in a row, or when all cells are filled resulting in a draw.
Basic Strategy
Center First: The center cell is the most strategic starting move.
Block Opponent: Always try to block your opponent from completing three in a row.
Fork: Create an opportunity where you have two ways to win (two non-blocked lines of two marks each).
